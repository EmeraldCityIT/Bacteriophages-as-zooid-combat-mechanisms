# Bacteriophages-as-zooid-combat-mechanisms
Bacteriophages are reusable mechanical systems created by zooids for injection of weaponized enzymes into toxic cells. Appearance of these mechanical devices within our bodies shows intelligent design and engineering of both advanced mechanical structures and advanced weaponized enzymes. While these mechanical systems are operated by zooids within the body, their structure is a mechanical system which is developed by hemoglobin.

A T1 bacteriophage has a mass of 1.6e+7 Da, 11.3 of this consists of DNA.

A t4 bacteriophage has a mass of 7.95e+7 Amu


Determining elemental composition of phages.

Using the Public Chemistry Reference Database, bacteriophage elemental makeup can be determined in order to experiment with or to replicate bacteriophages for open study.

Using potassium as a reference, around 373,473 atoms would be required to construct the mechanical framwork of a bacteriophage.
